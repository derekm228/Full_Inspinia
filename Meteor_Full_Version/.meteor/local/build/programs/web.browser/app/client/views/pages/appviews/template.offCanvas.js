He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a\n                            little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff\n                            sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.\n                            His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about\n                            helplessly as he looked. "What\'s happened to me?" he thought. It wasn\'t a dream. His room, a\n                            proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar\n                            walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling\n                            salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated\n                            magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and\n                            fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm\n                            towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of\n                                the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place\n                                and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

She packed her\n                            seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached\n                            the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her\n                            hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road,\n                            the Line Lane.
